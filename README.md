This project outlines development of a facial emotion recognition system that uses deep learning to analyze facial expressions and categorize emotions.

## 📃 Dataset
The model was trained using the FER-2013 dataset, which has 48x48 pixel grayscale images with labeled facial expressions.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🎥 **Real-time emotion recognition**: Uses a webcam to detect faces and show emotions like 😄 Happy, 😢 Sad, 😐 Neutral, 😠 Angry, 😲 Surprise.
- 🖼️ **Image Prediction**: Predicts emotions on uploaded images.
- 🌐 **Web App**: A simple Flask app to use the system through a web browser.
