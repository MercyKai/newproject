# Facial emotion recognition
This project outlines the development of a facial emotion recognition system that uses deep learning to analyze facial expressions and categorize the emotions.
# Dataset
The model was trained using the FER-2013 dataset, which has 48x48 pixel grayscale images with labeled facial expressions.
# Features
- Real-time emotion recognition: Detects faces from a live webcam feed using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. Using a trained CNN, it recognizes emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprise, and others.  
- Output: Displays the predicted emotions directly on the webcam feed.  
- Flask Web Application: A web interface to interact with the emotion recognition model using real-time emotion detection.
