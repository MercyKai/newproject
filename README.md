# Facial Emotion Recognition

This project outlines the development of a facial emotion recognition system that uses deep learning to analyze facial expressions and categorize the emotions.

## Dataset
The model was trained using the FER-2013 dataset, which has 48x48 pixel grayscale images with labeled facial expressions.

## Features

- **Real-time emotion recognition**: Uses a webcam to detect faces and show emotions like happy, sad, angry, etc.
- **Image Prediction**: Uploaded images show the predicted emotion.
- **Web App**: A simple Flask app to use the system through a web browser.
